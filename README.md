## Philosophy
The Atomic Agents framework is designed to be modular, extensible, and easy to use. It provides a set of tools and agents that can be combined to create powerful applications. The framework is built on top of [Instructor](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor) and leverages the power of [Pydantic](https://docs.pydantic.dev/latest/) for data validation and serialization.
