# Atomic Agents

Atomic Agents is a framework for building and running AI agents using a modular approach. It is designed to be easy to understand, extend, and maintain.

There are two main components to the Atomic Agents framework:

1. **Atomic Agents** - The core framework for building and running AI agents.
2. **Atomic Assembler** - A CLI tool for creating, testing, and publishing your own Atomic Tools.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.10 or later

### Installation

1. Install the Atomic Agents package through pip:
   ```bash
   pip install atomic-agents
   ```

2. Install the Atomic Assembler CLI. This is optional, but it provides a convenient way to grab new Atomic Tools from the [Atomic Forge](@atomic-forge):
   ```bash
   pip install atomic-assembler
   ```
