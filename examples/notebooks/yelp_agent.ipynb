    "Before proceeding with this notebook, it is highly recommended to read up on the basics of the following libraries:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Pydantic**: A data validation and settings management library using Python type annotations. You can find more information and documentation at [Pydantic GitHub](https://github.com/pydantic/pydantic).\n",
    "- **Instructor**: A Python library that simplifies working with structured outputs from large language models (LLMs). It provides a user-friendly API to manage validation, retries, and streaming responses. More details can be found at [Instructor GitHub](https://github.com/jxnl/instructor).\n",
